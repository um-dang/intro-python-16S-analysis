# A Gentle Introduction to Data Science with Python
Python is a capable and free (open source) programming language well-suited for analysis of data, including microbiome data. Together, we will go through a real-life example, re-analyzing microbiome - immune checkpoint inhibitor studies. We will touch on both the basics (loading in data, transforming, graphing, basic statistical analysis, and outputting data and figures), and use the examples to compare and contrast with some equivalents in R. This introduction should be suitable for those with no data analysis with code experience, but have some added dimensions for those familiar with R.
